# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee data from a fictional organization. Using a curated HR dataset, I’ve built a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as employee demographics, departmental performance, satisfaction scores, attrition trends, and recruitment patterns. It offers actionable insights that HR teams can use to improve engagement and retention.

## 📁 Dataset Details
The dataset includes records for 311 employees and covers fields such as:
- **Demographics:** Name, Age, Gender, Marital Status, Race, Citizenship
- **Employment Info:** Department, Position, Manager, Date of Hire & Termination
- **Performance & Satisfaction:** Performance Score, Engagement Survey, Absences, Special Projects
- **Recruitment:** Source of hire, Diversity job fair participation
- **Status:** Employment type, Termination reason

## 🔍 Dashboard Highlights
- 🚻 **Gender Distribution:** Visual breakdown of male vs. female employees
- 💍 **Marital Status Trends:** Insights into how relationship status correlates with attrition
- 💰 **Department-wise Salary Analysis:** Identifies salary ranges across teams
- 📉 **Attrition Rate Analysis:** Highlights departments and managers with highest attrition
- 🧲 **Recruitment Effectiveness:** Compares sources like LinkedIn, Indeed, and referrals
- 📊 **Employee Satisfaction:** Measures satisfaction across teams and roles

## 🛠️ Tools Used
